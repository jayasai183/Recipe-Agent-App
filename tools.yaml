      Use this tool to execute a SQL statement.

      A highly capable tool for executing SQL queries against the four
      Recipe Agent database tables. ALWAYS use this tool for questions 
      regarding recipes, ingredients, or inventory. 
      
      The database schema is as follows:
      - Recipes (RecipeID, Name, Cuisine, PrepTime, CookTime, Instructions)
      - Ingredients (IngredientID, IngredientName, Unit)
      - Recipe_Ingredients (RecipeID, IngredientID, Quantity, UnitNeeded)
      - Inventory (IngredientID, StockQuantity, StockUnit)
      
      Use SQL joins (e.g., JOIN Recipe_Ingredients ON ...) and WHERE clauses 
      (e.g., WHERE Cuisine='Italian') as needed to answer the user's request.
